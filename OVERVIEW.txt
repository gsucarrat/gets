The R package 'gets': Overview of the files and folders on Github
=================================================================

The source code of the package is contained in two files:

  gets-base-source.R
  gets-isat-source.R

The latter contains the source code related to the isat() function, whereas the former contains the rest. The associated help files, description file and so on are contained in the folder named

  gets-devel

To create or build the tarball, the file make-and-check-tarball.R is used. Its result is the tarball named gets_devel.tar.gz, which is the file that is uploaded to CRAN once a new version is ready. The folder 0-past-versions contains (recent) past versions, and 0-test-files contains most of the files used to test and check the code before a new version is released.

The remaining files are auxiliary files, or prototypes of new ideas and functionality.
